  3.2- Enable to delete invoice and change each of its clockin's invoice.Code

- date in Invoices list is "010" instead of "10" => considerer creating a pattern "Jan 10, 2020"
  X010 is fixed, but need to use the pattern. this.formatDate in InvoiceModal is okay to be a functional componenet and be used in other components
    solution: created a funcion .show in ./aux/formatDate.js which handle pretty good the date formating
- sort/order invoices by date - in render table
  Xdone: 
    solution: .sort({date: -}
- in Invoice's List Generator, add a last row to sum up "total hours" and "total $"
  Xdone
- enable scroll in Invoice's modals
  Xdone
- format email to be sent when punched in
  Xdone
- Hamburger menu color to Wheat, Invoice Generator text, Clockin email subject, no Edit button in InvoiceList mobile
  Xdone
