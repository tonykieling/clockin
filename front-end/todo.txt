TODO
1. User
  X1.1- A user Home page clicked through ClockinJS instead user data
  X1.2- in Home cancel is not working, - ClientList it's working
    solved by onChange instead of onBlur method on the bootstrap component
  X1.3- record data after changing user data
  1.4- forget password
  1.5- change password

2. Client
  2.1- style buttons from clientList as in User Home component
    trying to mimic User, but it's not working
  X2.2- clientList is hidding the whole card when name is empty because it's checking whether there is props.name
    solved by checking clientId
  X2.3- format and style Add new Client as User Home
    fileds name are too big to fit in col sm={2}. Keeping two lines (label + text field)
  2.4- format and style clientList as User Home
    some are working, but others dont

  X? How to get "Select Client" in the button after editing some data?
    passing client as props solves that issue

3. Punch in
 3.1- format data and time pickers
 3.2- after insert new clockin, client's button should be "Select client" label
 3.3- allow edit button (as a modal)
  able to change date, timeStart, timeEnd, rate or delete the clockin

4. Invoices
  4.1- format date and time pickers
  4.2- ...
  
  4.3- Add Code in the db structure
  when hit "Invoice's Generator", the user should add this info, which can be queried by the clockings from the previous month
   Invoice Code should appear when listing Clockins || "not yet"
  Clockins with a Invoice related to cannot be delete (the button should not come out)
