This is a migration version.
The system is going to be deployed at vercel, so I need to refactor the backend for a serverless approach.
The front-end need some adjustments mainly in the url to be reached.


1- get rid of
  /Procfile
  /server.js

2- edit /package.json
  remove "start"

3- thinking of a strategy for accomodating the backend routes and how the UI is gonna query it.

4- see routes-strategy.txt

need to confirm which methods are being used: get, post, delete and patch? Yeah!

  --- when trying to reach 'localhost:3000:/login' it does not load the fe, instead it tries the route.
      after localhost:3000 and the fe is been loaded, it is okay
      ? how to make it load the fe instead trying a be route???

  --- signUp seems to be working,
  but it is not sendind email
    guess it needs a new sender id from gmail
  => turns out, I changed the place where where the helper is called, checed gmail, got rid of the dotenv requires
    and it seems to be working.
    Another thing, the variables from process.env, in "vercel dev" regards from local .env, not variables on vercel
